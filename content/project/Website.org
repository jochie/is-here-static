* Status
Active in its current form since November 2023 and its current location since March 2025.
* What
My personal website.
* Where
Right [[https://is-here.com/][here]].
* Content
Everything on here has been generated once by a so-called [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator][SSG]] and then dropped in place.

The content is generated with [[https://gohugo.io/][Hugo]]. I picked the [[https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/gohugo-theme-ananke/][Ananke]] theme, and made some minor modifications:

- Modified the default Hugo RSS template (=layouts/_default/rss.xml=):
  - Change the feed to include full posts instead of just the summary
  - Add =<category>= tag(s)
- Copied and modified the default single (post/project) page (=layouts/_default/single.html=):
  - Include an optional "Updated ..." bit after the original post date
  - Move the context menu (with the table of contents and related posts) before the content, which places it to the left of the text, or at the top of page instead of at the bottom in a small screen situation
- Copied and adapted the main page (=layouts/index.html=) just to make the text there /not/ be centered.
- Copied and adapted the footer (=layouts/partials/site-footer.html=) just so I could make the copyright years be a range instead of just the current year. I tried to put the beginning of the range in the =copyright= configuration setting but then that ended up looking funny in the RSS source

Beyond that, I've left the theme as-is and I'm taking advantage of its (and Hugo's) features.
* Hosting
Until March 2025 the static site was hosted in an [[https://aws.amazon.com/][AWS]] S3 bucket, made available through a Cloudfront distribution to make it available via =https=.

At that point, I moved it to [[https://www.statichost.eu/][statichost.eu]], which specializes in hosting SSGs, directly from Git repositories, and hosting it with =http= and =https=.
* Keeping up with the Joneses?
As so often happens, I looked away for one minute (alright, closer to 4-5 months) and the version of Hugo that I get when I do a fresh install (from [[https://brew.sh/][Brew]]) is a /bit/ different than what I started with, and that is going to break some things.

To give myself a stable work environment and breathing space I decided to run the =hugo= command inside a quick'n'dirty container:

- The =Dockerfile=
  #+begin_src text
    FROM cibuilds/hugo:0.119.0

    EXPOSE 1313
  #+end_src
- A super simple =Makefile=
  #+begin_src text
    hugo-docker:
            docker build --tag myhugo .

    server-beta:
            docker-helper server --bind 0.0.0.0 --environment beta

    server-live:
            ./docker-helper server --bind 0.0.0.0 --environment live

    deploy-beta:
            ./docker-helper --environment beta && ./docker-helper deploy --environment beta

    deploy-live:
            ./docker-helper --environment live && ./docker-helper deploy --environment live
  #+end_src
- And a shell script to glue it all together:
  #+begin_src shell
    #!/bin/sh

    if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
        echo "Usage: $0 <hugo-arguments>" 1>&2
        exit 1
    fi

    DIR=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
    docker run -v $HOME/.aws:/home/circleci/.aws -v $DIR:$DIR -p 1313:1313 -w $(pwd) -it myhugo hugo $*
  #+end_src
  That script fires up the container with only the current Git repo exposed within the container, and starting off at the current working directory as well, then running the =hugo= version that I grabbed. It also shares =~/.aws= for the deployment steps.

Now I can run a command like this and I can sanity check that the site is going to look ok with that particular version, and then later figure out what needs to be fixed as I nudge the version along at my own pace:
#+begin_src shell
make server-beta
#+end_src

And then deploy when I'm happy:
#+begin_src shell
make deploy-live
#+end_src

Noting that now that I've moved to [[https://www.statichost.eu/][statichost.eu]] the =deploy-*= targets are obsolete, but it's still useful to test locally with =server-*=.
